# Langchain_Falcon_Project
Hi, Welcome to the ChatGPT WebApp. This app is developed using :
- [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html)
- [Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/overview)
- [HuggingFaceHub](https://huggingface.co/models)
- [Falcon_7B_TextGeneration_LLM](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b)

# Examples to try 

- Write a tweet for Falcon_7B promoting their new hoodie merchandise.
- How to make pasta sauce?
- Write 5 synonyms of word help.

# Features

- Falcon 7B Instruct is the UAE’s and the Middle East’s first home-grown, open-source large language model (LLM) with 40 billion parameters trained on one trillion tokens.
- It is small but powerful in itself.

# Bias, Risks, and Limitations

Falcon-7B is trained on English and French data only, and will not generalize appropriately to other languages. Furthermore, as it is trained on a large-scale corpora representative of the web, it will carry the stereotypes and biases commonly encountered online.

# How to run locally?

- Clone the repository
- Open `example.env` file and enter your own [Hugging Face Access Token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). Rename `example.env` to `.env` file
